    "In this chapter , we will present the data analyzed for visualization purposes.\n",

    "## Tools\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, this internship is done only using python programming language. We will use Dash-plotly as a framework.\n",

    "### What is Dash ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash is a python framework created by plotly for creating interactive web applications. Dash is written on the top of Flask, Plotly.js and React.js.Dash is open source and the application build using this framework are viewed on the web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dash application is made of two building blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layout :** It defines the structure of the application . Elements used such as dropdowns , buttons , graphs etc and the placement , size , color etc. Dash contains Dash HTML components which we can create and style HTML content such as heading, paragraph, images etc using python . Elements such as dropdowns, graphs, cards are created using Dash Core components.\n",
    "Dash also includes Dash Bootstrap components that makes it easier to build consistently styled apps with complex, responsive layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callbacks :** Are used to bring interactivity to the dash application. These are the functions using which, for example, we can define the activity that would happen on clicking a button or a dropdown.\n",
