    "\n",
    "### What is Kloppy ?\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned kloppy is a great package , It provides (de)serializers, standardized data models, filters, and transformers to facilitate work with different tracking and event data from various providers,So its main features are to load data and transform it into standardized models and vice versa.\n",
    "In the following sections we will try to break-down the package to better understand the process and it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kloppy providers\n",
    "Kloppy support numerous provider with different format file (JSON & LXML) as the table below shows.\n",
    "To simplify the process, these providers display a different data structure within each format, \"Kloppy\" will proceed with each one to provide the same final result structure for each game. \n",

    "\n",
    "Black :\n",
    ": Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting.\n",
    "Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lxml :\n",
    ": The lxml XML toolkit is a Pythonic binding for the C libraries libxml2 and libxslt. It is unique in that it combines the speed and XML feature completeness of these libraries with the simplicity of a native Python API, mostly compatible but superior to the well-known ElementTree API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests :\n",
    ": Python module that you can use to send all kinds of HTTP requests. It is an easy-to-use library with a lot of features ranging from passing parameters in URLs to sending custom headers and SSL Verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "NetworkX :\n",
    ": This python package is used for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It is used to study large complex networks represented in form of graphs with nodes and edges. Using networkx we can load and store complex networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTest :\n",
    ": PyTest is a testing framework that allows users to write test codes using Python programming language. It helps you to write simple and scalable test cases for databases, APIs, or UI. PyTest is mainly used for writing tests for APIs. It helps to write tests from simple unit tests to complex functional tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas :\n",
    ": pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-commit :\n",
    ": A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit Git hooks."
